title: How Shiftmates Got Started

Imagine a world where anyone can pick up a job at any time and work whenever they want! With Shiftmates, we making that vision a reality! We want to make a real-time "shift marketplace" where employers can post a shift and anyone can pick up the job at their leisure. Anyone, anywhere who has spare time on their hands can turn their free time into productive time by picking up a work shift in their spare time. 
 
## How we got started ##
Shiftmates started as a hackathon project for the Capital One hackathon in SF in June 2014. We came together with an idea of a shared workforce similar to what TaskRabbit does, except for regular (non-contract) workers. We wanted to make a platform where people would no longer have to bend their life to fit around their work schedule- instead, they could schedule work around their life.
 
The first version of Shiftmates (the one that was submitted at the hackathon) was nothing more than a simple 3-screen single-page-app made with jQueryMobile and hosted on Parse.com. It was a minimal proof-of-concept with about 3 screens- a signup/login page, a list of open shifts, and a screen to add an open shift.

## After the hackathon ##
After the hackathon, we realized that we had a chance to change the world. Shiftmates could not only make recruiting and hiring easier for businesses, but it could also help everyone by making employment more flexible! A win-win situation!

We restarted Shiftmates and built it out as a web app instead of a mobile app (but with an option to go mobile in the future!). In our first post-hackathon version, we had a basic scheduling app that incorporated a calendar, basic shift/employee information, and only email notifications.

Our first user gave us a lot of feedback about basic scheduling functions that would be useful to everyone. Stuff like repeating shifts, self-scheduling, and printable schedules. Around this time (August 2014) we also started experimenting with a different approach to work scheduling, where the workers could make their own groups and trade shifts amongst themselves, without requiring the entire business/organization to be signed up on Shiftmates. 

We started talking to a lot of stores everywhere about their experience with trading shifts and scheduling time off and shift trades. Generally, people have a fixed work schedule and trading shifts has so much associated overhead and paperwork that it was not work it.

Many of the responses were that people simply did not trade as often as they would like! Instead, everyone bends their schedule to fit with their work schedule because of the HUGE hassle of changing their work schedule. For example, one retail store showed us a 3-inch thick binder containing schedules for everyone for the entire month, along with trade request slips, approvals, and timesheets. If that binder were to go missing, imagine how many hours of lost productivity that would cause!

## Y Combinator ##
Around this time, we also applied to Y Combinator for their Winter 2015 batch. We were overjoyed to be accepted for an interview, and met with a few of the partners at YC! It was a valiant effort, but alas, we were unable to convince them to hand us their money. Nevertheless, it was a great experience and helped us focus on what we needed to do in order to make Shiftmates happen.

Shiftmates is now in a closed beta, and we are looking for users who can give us feedback to help us make the experience better! If you or anyone you know would like to try out Shiftmates, please sign up on our mailing list at shiftmates.net.
